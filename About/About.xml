	<description>Unofficial update to 1.6!\n\nI did my best to update this mod to 1.6. Most features should be working again. Do note that pokemon fishing is completely broken at the moment, and the spawn rates for pokemon in the new Odyssey biomes are placeholders for now. I will admit I did not test this very thoroughly, so let me know if you find any bugs!\n\nI also tried to add some compatibility with Big &amp; Small: Sapient Animals (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3505241400), and while I've gotten it to a state where sapient pokemon are playable, there's still a lot of problems, like levels and shininess being reset on gaining sapience, and the moves inspector tab and evolutions being bugged on sapient pokemon, so if you decide to play with this mod, do so knowing that it's a bit unstable at the moment.\n\nOriginal Description:\n\nPokéWorld adds species of Pokémon from the first eight Pokémon generations to RimWorld, each with their own unique characteristics akin to the original games.\n\nTry and catch as many of these Pokémon as you can to fill up your Pokédex, battle against other wild Pokémon and raiders to gain experience and level up your Pokémon, who will learn more powerful moves and eventually evolve to grow ever stronger!\n\nUnlike your regular RimWorld animal, Pokémon can't be tamed by simply having your colonist walk up to them. Instead, you'll need to use specially crafted PokéBall belts to catch these Pokémon. But be careful! Most of them won't let themselves be caught without a fight!\n\nOnce caught, you can choose to assign your newly caught Pokémon to a colonist whom it will follow and protect, or let them rest in their PokéBall until it is later needed.\n\nPokémon aren't the only new addition this mod adds to RimWorld. Keep your eyes wide open when mining in the dark caves, for you might stumble onto rare treasure among the rocks, such as rare evolution stones, or, even rarer, ancient fossils buried deep for eons. Who knows, with the right tools, you might be able to bring these fossil back to life.\n\nOnce you start learning more and more about these strange creatures by filling your Pokédex, you'll eventually find yourself on the track of exceptionally powerful Pokémon, only ever heard of in myths and legends.\n\nFinally, although it is only just a rumour, it is said amongst the ancient tribes living on this planet that some individual Pokémon can show a very rare coloration, similar to the shine of a bright midnight star.</description>
